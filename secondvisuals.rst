Second Visuals
=====================

Design
------------

Once the homepage and first visuals are approved we design the second visuals.

These are a number of pages for the rest of the site which we then extend the visual
style of the homepage design to. The number of pages and functionality we showcase
at this point depends on whether the initial starting point was a ‘Package’ Site or a
Bespoke Wireframe...

For Wireframe sites we do a designs for the following pages:

• Category
• Product
• Contact
• About / CMS Page
• Basket
• Checkout
• Blog (If applicable)

For Package Sites we do designs for the following pages:

• Category
• Product
• Blog (If applicable – sometimes following a pre-made template (see on a separate blog site).

Sometimes other pages will be requested for the second visuals. This will be bought
up in the task.

Second Visuals Supply
------------

Add designs for all the new pages in the second visuals to a new PDF combined with the previous homepage and over state visuals.

Put the original homepage states first in the pdf and then the designs for the new pages in after.

Add this PDF to the Asana task and send back to the account handler.

Amends from Account Handler &/ or Client
------------

After supplying the second visuals there may be amends from either the account handler, or the client or both.

• Amends from the account handler will be before the PDF is sent to the client. Update the designs with the suggestions and then re-supply the PDF to the task and assign back to the account handler.
• Follow the same process for amends from the client.

Once the designs are approved the PSD needs to be formatted for a developer which involves creating assets and instructions.
