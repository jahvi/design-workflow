Media Lounge Design Workflow
=============================

The following guide describes the design processes adhered to when working on Media Lounge projects.
It also details the process that is integrated for feedback on design, as well as our standards for folders and storing files.

This guide is always open for review and improvements whenever the processes change, the code is
open source so any member of the Media Lounge team is welcome to contribute to it.
